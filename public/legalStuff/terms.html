    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>Effective Date: 20/6/2025</p>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>AniFlow</strong> (“the Site”). This website is a non-commercial, fan-created project
        developed for educational and entertainment purposes only. By accessing or using the Site, you agree to be bound
        by these Terms of Service (“Terms”). If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the Site.</p>

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>This website allows users to browse anime content and stream embedded videos from publicly available platforms
        such as AniOneAsia via YouTube, and access anime data from third-party APIs including AniList and TMDB. The Site
        does not host any video files or copyrighted media on its servers.</p>

    <h2>2. Not Affiliated with Rights Holders</h2>
    <p>The Site is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or associated with Crunchyroll, AniOneAsia, TMDB, AniList, YouTube,
        or any other official anime licensors, distributors, or streaming services. All anime titles, images, character

    <p>
        This website embeds publicly available video content from AniOneAsia via YouTube. It does not host or upload any
        video content directly. All anime-related metadata (titles, descriptions, images, episode info) was collected
        during development using publicly available APIs from AniList, TMDB, and YouTube, and is now served from a local
        static data store. No live API calls occur on the client side.
    </p>
