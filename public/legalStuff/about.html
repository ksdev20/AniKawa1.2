    <h1>About This Project</h1>
    <p>This website is a personal fan-made project inspired by anime streaming platforms like Crunchyroll, but built
        from scratch using open APIs and public data sources. It is non-commercial and exists to explore UI/UX, design,
        and development in a real-world project context.</p>

    <h2>Inspiration</h2>
    <p>Visually inspired by Crunchyroll, but no code or assets were copied. Layout and logic were built independently
        for educational purposes.</p>

    <h2>Data & Video Sources</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Anime metadata is sourced from AniList and TMDB</li>
        <li>Videos are embedded only from AniOneAsia’s official YouTube channel</li>
        <li>We do not host, modify, or download any video files</li>
    </ul>
