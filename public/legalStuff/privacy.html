    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective Date: 20/6/2025</p>

    <p>
        At <strong>Anikawa</strong>, we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains
        what data we collect, how we use it, and how it is protected. By using the website, you agree to this policy.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>We collect data only from users who register and log in. We do not collect any personal information from
        non-logged-in visitors.</p>

    <p>For registered users, we collect the following data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Email address</li>
        <li>Password (encrypted using bcrypt)</li>
        <liProfile name (defaulted from email)</li>
            <li>Profile picture and banner (defaults are used unless customized)</li>
            <li>Watchlist (user-selected anime)</li>
            <li>Viewing history (anime you've watched)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How Your Data is Stored</h2>
    <p>
        Your data is stored securely in our MongoDB database. Passwords are hashed using bcrypt and are never stored in
        plain text. Only your email and non-sensitive profile data are accessible via secure queries.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Cookies</h2>
    <p>
        We set a single HTTP-only cookie called <code>userID</code> after you log in. This cookie is used only to keep
        you logged in and expires automatically after 7 days. No tracking cookies or third-party cookies are used.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Local Storage</h2>
    <p>
        We use local storage on your browser to cache anime-related data or personal UI settings. No private data is
        stored here.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Embedded Content</h2>
    <p>
        Some videos on this site are embedded from AniOneAsia's official YouTube channel. When you play these videos,
        YouTube may collect your viewing behavior in accordance with its own <a
            href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>. We do not control or track
        this data.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Analytics (Optional/Future)</h2>
    <p>
        In the future, we may integrate basic analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics) to understand how the site is
        used. If used, it will collect only anonymized data such as device type and page views. You will be able to opt
        out.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
        We do not sell, rent, or share your data with any third parties. Your data remains private and is only used to
        support your experience on the platform.
    </p>
